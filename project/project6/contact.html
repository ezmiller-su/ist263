            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Vision and Goals: Our vision is to serve the Syracuse community with merchandise that reflects their spirit and style. This will be done with four clothing drops from fall semester 2024 to when we graduate in spring 2026. Our goals of the four total drops are to bring people together by promoting school spirit, highlighting local art, and creating shared experiences. Although we hope to make money with this venture profit will not be a primary goal for apparel drops. We would like our apparel to be seen as a combination of culture, media, and art rather than a capitalist venture. Profit will be the primary focus of the custom shirts sector of our business where a portion of revenue will go into growing the apparel drops.</p>
