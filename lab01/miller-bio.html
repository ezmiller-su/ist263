    <body>
        I'm currently an Information Management & Technology major, Psychology major and Business minor. As a musician I'm interested in using these skills in the entertainment industry.
        I play guitar, ride enduro MTB and studied the IB program in high school. I grew up near London, UK. My favorite TV show is The Wire.
